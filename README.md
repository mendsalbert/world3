## Problem

In the realm of charitable donations, various obstacles impede the seamless and effective support of causes. These obstacles include lack of transparency, limited donation options, and complex processes for both donors and beneficiaries. As a result, individuals who wish to make a difference face difficulties in finding trustworthy and efficient platforms to contribute to causes they care about. Consequently, the traditional donation landscape falls short in providing a seamless and rewarding experience for donors and charities alike.

## Solution: Vidispark and its Features

To address these challenges, our donation app harnesses the power of Chainlink's decentralized oracle network and smart contract technology. By integrating Chainlink services into our platform, we revolutionize the way people contribute to charitable causes with enhanced reliability, security, and transparency.

Through Chainlink's decentralized oracle network, our donation app ensures accurate and real-time data for various functionalities. For example, we leverage Chainlink Price Feeds to provide up-to-date and reliable conversion rates between different currencies, allowing donors to contribute in their preferred fiat or cryptocurrency. This ensures that the donation amounts are accurately reflected and enables seamless transactions for donors around the world.

Additionally, our app utilizes Chainlink Keepers to automate important processes within our platform. We can set threshold-based triggers that automatically execute actions when certain donation milestones or events are reached. This streamlines operations and improves efficiency, enabling charities to focus more on their impactful work rather than manual monitoring.

Chainlink's VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is employed to ensure fair and transparent distribution of rewards, incentives, or prizes within our donation app. By generating provably random and tamper-proof results, we enhance trust and integrity in the selection process, fostering a sense of fairness among donors and beneficiaries.

With Chainlink's robust infrastructure and cutting-edge technology, our donation app provides a secure and reliable ecosystem for charitable giving. Donors can have peace of mind knowing that their contributions are accurately processed, securely handled, and allocated to the intended causes. Charities benefit from increased trust, transparency, and operational efficiency, allowing them to focus their resources on making a positive impact.

By leveraging Chainlink services, our donation app revolutionizes the way individuals engage with charitable causes, creating a seamless, transparent, and trustworthy platform for donors and charities alike. Together, we can drive meaningful change and empower a global community of philanthropists to make a lasting impact on the world.

Smart Contract Address - 0xdF3073768De7e417E55d764f881e144477d39b5e

## Prerequisite

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en// "Node") Installed

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git OFficial") Installed

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/ "npm ") Installed

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/ "Hardhat ") Installed

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/mendsalbert/world3
```

2. Change the working directory

```Bash
cd vidispark
```

3. Start the local Hardhat node

```Bash
npx hardhat node
```

4. With the network running, deploy the contracts to the local network in a separate terminal window

```Bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network theta
```

5. Start the app

```Bash
npm run start
```

**üéá You are Ready to Go!**

## Configuration

The chain ID should be 365. If you have a localhost rpc set up, you may need to overwrite it.

<p align="center" title="Project Initiator"><img src="https://bafybeieuh2n62zhzw666m3fe77cc5xlandpfebcmtwyugdqf5b2nkxjmae.ipfs.w3s.link/Screenshot%202023-05-31%20at%2010.14.09%20AM.png" alt="Project Initiator"/></p>

To deploy to Polygon test or main networks, update the configurations located in hardhat.config.js to use a private key and, optionally, deploy to a private RPC like Infura.

```Bash
require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle');
const privateKey = 'xx';
const projectId = 'xx';

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: 'hardhat',
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 365,
    },
    theta: {
      url: 'https://eth-rpc-api-testnet.thetatoken.org/rpr',
      accounts: [privateKey],
    },
  },
  solidity: {
    version: '0.8.4',
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Value to the Theta Ecosystem

The Theta ecosystem has experienced rapid growth within the world of decentralization. To ensure its stability, diverse applications and systems need to be implemented. Video and streaming platforms have billions of users, and Vidispark believes the future of decentralization has arrived. By building on the Theta ecosystem, Vidispark contributes to its growth and development.

## Learnings and Challenges

During our journey to develop a fully decentralized video and streaming platform, we discovered that existing platforms typically have at least one centralized component. We take pride in being the first fully decentralized company to implement a decentralized video streaming platform. However, this presented various challenges, including integrating new decentralized platforms like WeaveDB, which required extensive collaboration with the Weave team via GitHub and direct contact.

Each challenge we encountered provided valuable lessons. Despite being college students, our team's passion and dedication enabled us to build this powerful and amazing project within a short timeframe.

We gained an in-depth understanding of the Theta ecosystem and how to utilize its components to solve real-world problems.
